# Obstacle-Detecting Car using Arduino

## ðŸš€ Working Principle
1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance to nearby objects by sending and receiving ultrasonic waves.
2. If an obstacle is detected within a certain range, the Arduino triggers the motor driver to stop or steer the car in a different direction.
3. The car continuously scans for obstacles and adjusts its path dynamically.
